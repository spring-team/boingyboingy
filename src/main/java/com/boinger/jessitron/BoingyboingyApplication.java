// I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

// You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.
